    Greetings        
    Now that we’ve understood language, let’s move to one of its most common and important uses – greetings.   
    
       
        Why Are Greetings Important?        
    Greetings are more than just words; they are expressions of respect, kindness, and goodwill.     
    When you greet someone, you acknowledge their presence and set the tone for your interaction.   
    
    For example, saying “Good morning” to your teacher shows respect, while saying “Hi” to a friend creates a friendly vibe.   
    A greeting can make someone feel valued, welcomed, and even brighten their day.   
    
       
        Common English Greetings        
    Let’s explore some common greetings used in English:    
    
       
        Formal Greetings:        
    - Good morning.     
    - Good afternoon.
